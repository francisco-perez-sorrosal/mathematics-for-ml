#### Week 1 (On Variances and Covariances)

Symmetric, positive (semi)-definite matrices are important when we discuss covariance matrices later, but what does it mean when we say that a matrix is positive (semi)-definite?

Please have a brief look at the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix) on positive definite matrices. Once we have introduced the concept of a covariance matrix, pause for a moment and think about why covariance matrices are indeed symmetric positive semidefinite.
